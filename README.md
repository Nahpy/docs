# Sayonika Unified Documentation Center

This repository contains all modding documentation and Sayonika docs in one simple centralized repository.

# Building

We use Jekyll and Netlify to serve this site. so make sure you have `jekyll` installed.

Read about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) here.

# Contributing

We do all the stuff in `_docs` so if you wanna add some new knowledge in docs, yu're free to do so! Keep in mind of these though:

- We use American English, not British English. 
- Use neutral wording - do not use possessive or first-person phrasings.
- Use clear and concise words. This is a documentation site, not your blog.
